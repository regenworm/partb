See additional information / details in the assignment description.

Directory structure:

data/   -- a directory with treebank files to use, the sentences are from the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus, preprocessed in a standard way +
only sentences <= 20 words are considered 

train20.txt  - the training set               
validation20.txt - a set to be used for tuning / debugging the model
validation20-100sents.txt - first 100 sentences from this set (for very intial debuggin)

test20.txt - the final test set


example-binarized-data/  -- a directory with examples of what it is expected in the assignment

train-tiny-lossless.txt  -- 500 first sentences from the training with binarization only (= H=1 V=Infinity Markovization)
train-tiny-h2v2.txt -- 500 first sentences from the training set with H=2 V=2 Markovization

Example use of the parser:

java -ea -Xmx1G -cp bin/ nlp.assignments.parsing.SimpleParser -train example-binarized-data/train-tiny-h2v2.txt -test data/validation20-100sents.txt

Estimate H=2 V=2 PCFG from the tiny training set, test on the 100 sentences from the validation set.

This should result in:

[Average]  P: 65.03 R: 61.25 F1: 63.08 EX: 15.0
(Percentage Precision / Recall / Their harmonic mean F1 / Exact match)
